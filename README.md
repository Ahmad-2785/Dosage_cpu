# dosage cpu
dosage is a 20bit single cycle RISC cpu based on harvard architecture with no cache or pipeline, <br />
by having very simple and reduced instruction set it can be used for educational purpose  <br />

# ISA
phase 1 cpu designed in logisim with a  reduced instruction set <br />

# Assembler
phase 2 <br />
we also write an assambler in order to runnig assambly on dosage <br />
you can find it python file. <br />

# hardware_description 
phase 3 <br />
this hardware also descripted in verilog <br />
so we can built dosage in physical world too!

# next:
running C on this cpu
