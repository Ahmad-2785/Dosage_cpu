# dosage cpu
dosage is a 20bit single cycle RISC cpu based on harvard architecture with no cache or pipeline, <br />
by having very simple and reduced instruction set it can be used for educational purpose  <br />

# Cpu design
in the first phase we designed our cpu in logisim with a reduced instruction set <br />
you can see the instruction set below: <br />

# Assembler
in the second phase we wrote an assambler in order to runnig assambly code on dosage <br />

# hardware_description 
in the third phase we descripted Dosage in verilog <br />
So lets build dosage in the real world too! <br />

# Running C:
in the third phase we designed a compiler  <br />
So lets run C on Dosage! <br />
